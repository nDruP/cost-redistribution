		<h3>Why this method of splitting?</h3>
		<p>
			Because you care about the financial comfort of the people you're splitting the bill with. <br>
			$50 matters way more to someone who makes $1000/month vs. someone who makes $2000 a month.<br>
			I don't think anyone wants to financially inconvenience their friends just by sharing with them. Neither do people want their friends to miss out on experiences because they can't afford it.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>What if someone lies about their income?</h3>
		<p>
			There's really nothing you can do about it except choose better people to split with...<br>
			I think this method works best with friends/family who are honest and upfront with their finances. By using this method of splitting, I hope this helps dispell the stigma of talking about money/income.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>What if someone uses this extra financial flexibility irresponsibly (i.e. spends more $ on unnecessary stuff)?</h3>
		<p>
			You're not responsible for their spending, and you've done what you can to make sure they're not in financial straits.<br> 
			Hopefully the honesty that comes with this method of splitting also opens up further discussion of finances.
