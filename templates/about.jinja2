<h3>Why this method of splitting?</h3>
<p>Because you care about the financial comfort of the people you're splitting the bill with.
$50 matters way more to someone who makes $1000/month vs. someone who makes $2000 a month.
Splitting a bill presumes you are sharing something with others. I don't think anyone wants to financially inconvenience their friends just by sharing with them.

<h3>What if someone lies about their income?</h3>
<p>If someone lies, then there's really nothing you can do about it.
I think this method only works with friends/family who are honest and upfront with their finances.
Hopefully using this method will dispell the stigma of talking about money/income.

<h3>What if someone uses this extra financial flexibility irresponsibly (i.e. spends more $ on unnecessary stuff)?</h3>
<p>Another person's spending is not your responsibility. You've done what you can to make sure they're not in financial straits. Hopefully the honesty that comes with this method of splitting also opens up further discussion of finances.
